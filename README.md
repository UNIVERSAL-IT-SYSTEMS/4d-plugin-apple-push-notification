4d-plugin-apple-push-notification
=================================
This plugin is a 4D implementation of the â€‹[http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction/Introduction.html Apple Push Notifications API]. It offers capability to send JSON packets ("payloads") to a specific application installed on a specific device (iPhone or iPad). It is the developer's responsibility to create an iOS application, register it with the appropriate provision, create the right SSL certificates and install it on a device. On the other hand, this plugin will take care of sending TCP data to that device in the expected format, with client side authentication and SSL.
